Caution: Regex Pattern for Chat Parsing
Please note that the regex pattern used for parsing chat data in this project has certain limitations and may not handle all edge cases perfectly. While it works for most standard WhatsApp chat exports, the following points should be kept in mind:

Chat Format Variations: WhatsApp chat exports may vary depending on the version of the app and the operating system. Ensure your chat data follows the standard format that the regex pattern expects.

Date and Time Formats: The regex pattern is designed to work with a specific date and time format. If your chat data uses a different format, you might need to adjust the pattern accordingly.

Before running the analysis, it's recommended to review a sample of your chat data to ensure compatibility with the regex pattern. If you encounter issues, you may need to modify the pattern in preprocessor.py to better suit your data.
